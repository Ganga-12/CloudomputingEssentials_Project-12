Report:
Smallest Log File:

    All log files have the same size: 0 bytes. Therefore, based on the current data, they are all the smallest in size.

Largest Log File:

    All log files have the same size: 0 bytes. Hence, there is no significant difference in the file sizes at the moment.

Actionable Recommendations for Storage Optimization:

    Empty log files: Given that all the log files are currently 0 bytes, these files do not occupy significant storage. However, if you anticipate future logs growing in size, you can implement a log rotation system to prevent them from becoming too large and consuming excessive storage over time.

    Monitoring Log File Sizes: Consider setting up a cron job or scheduled task to periodically monitor the size of these log files and generate alerts when their size exceeds a threshold. This will help in proactively managing disk space.

    Log Cleanup: If these log files aren't being used, you could consider archiving or deleting older logs to free up space, especially if you don't need to retain every log file indefinitely.

    Log Rotation: Implement a log rotation policy (e.g., using logrotate on Linux) to keep the log files from growing indefinitely and to manage storage efficiently.
